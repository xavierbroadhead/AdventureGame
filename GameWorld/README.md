# AdventureGame
A final group project done for SWEN225. 

1. Run the ApplicationWindow class in the Applications Package.
2. Use the direction buttons to move and the action buttons on the right to act.
3. Move around the map to look for keys that open doors.
4. Find the right path to complete the game.
5. There is a MapEditor option to modify the game - This works by clicking the map areas
	while selecting an item which is then placed in the top down view of the map.
